train_sophia_v5.py — Sophia Elya nano-GPT for N64 (4-LAYER, CTX=64)

KEY CHANGES vs v4:
  1. N_LAYERS: 2 → 4  (deeper model, better reasoning chains)
  2. CTX: 32 → 64     (double context — prompt=14-20 chars leaves 44-50 for response)
  3. N_STEPS: 60000 → 100000  (more training for larger model)
  4. Same high-quality training data as v4 (122 QA pairs + 303 corpus lines)
  5. Output: sophia_weights_v5.bin (~458KB weights)

Architecture: 4 layers, 128 embed, 4 heads, Q4 quantized, ctx=64
This matches the updated nano_gpt.h with SGAI_N_LAYERS=4, SGAI_CTX=64.
